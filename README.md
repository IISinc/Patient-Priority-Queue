# Patient-Priority-Queue
A Java implementation of a **priority queue using a max-heap**, designed to simulate patient triage in a healthcare setting.  
Patients with higher priority values are always processed first.

# Project Description

This project demonstrates how a priority queue works internally by implementing it **from scratch**, without using Java’s built-in `PriorityQueue` class.

Patients are stored in a max-heap structure where:
- Higher priority values indicate more urgent patients
- The most critical patient is always treated next

# Features
- Add patients with a name and priority level
- Automatically maintains heap structure
- Retrieves and removes the highest-priority patient
- Efficient insertion and removal (`O(log n)`)
- Fully commented for learning purposes

# Concepts Demonstrated
- Data Structures (Heap / Priority Queue)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Recursion
- ArrayList manipulation
- Algorithm design
